recipeinstructions:
- "This is roughly all the ingredients.  You don&#39;t need too much meat. Get two kinds of generous amounts of green onions. Let&#39;s started with the preparations!"
- "Coarsely chop the Japanese leek to mix with the ground meat. You can use the core and shriveled parts for this. Finely chop the ginger and garlic."
- "For the briefly simmered greens: You can use small scallions or leafy greens. A fatter leek is better-tasting than the small ones. You can use the green part of the scallions as well. Cut it into long strips."
- "Flavoring ingredients - Mix the ingredients well and set aside.  It should look like this."
- "Use 2 kinds of Korean red chili pepper if possible. The powdered type will give the dish a nice color. If you can only find one kind, double the amount of what you have.  Japanese red chili pepper cannot be substituted ."
- "In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, the ☆ ingredients and the white pepper.  Mix the grainy meat to loosen up its fibers by kneading in the ☆ ingredients."
- "Once it&#39;s well mixed, drizzle in a small amount of sesame oil and mix it evenly, so that when the meat is cooked, it doesn&#39;t get crumbly."
- "Start sautéing. First, add the meat in a cold skillet.  If the meat does not have enough fat, drizzle in a small amount of the sesame oil little by little while sautéing the meat."
- "Once the oil comes out, turn up the heat and cook it though.   This way, the ground meat will cook up without crumbling."
- "When the meat is cooked through, add the sardine powder. This ingredient is very important.  When it starts to cook, it will smell wonderful! Always use dried sardines instead of bonito flakes for Korean cooking."
- "Crumble the tofu with your hands and add to the skillet. No need to drain the tofu. Pour in 1.5 cups of water and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low when it comes to a boil."
- "Remove any scum or grease thoroughly and pour the flavoring ingredients. Using a wooden spoon, stir the skillet as if scratching the bottom of the skillet without flipping the tofu."
- "Soft tofu will fall apart easily in rapidly boiling liquid, so reduce heat to low and simmer it for about 10 minutes."
- "For adults, add more red chili pepper. It doens&#39;t taste that hot with the additional pepper. If you like spicy food, add as much as you like!"
- "When it&#39;s about done cooking, simmer the white part of the scallions along the side of the pan, and then add the green part at the end to briefly cook them."
- "And it&#39;s done. The big rice bowl that you see is just my usual."
- "Pour on some soup and just devour it. Try eating with steaming hot rice with steaming hot soup on top."
- "P.S. This is the gochujang that I am using at home. It&#39;s not too hot nor too harsh or bitter. It&#39;s easy to adjust the taste, plus it&#39;s easy to get!"
- "This is &#34;Pan-fried tofu with gochujang&#34;.  It&#39;s easy and budget-friendly. Give it a try."
