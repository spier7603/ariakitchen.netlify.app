- " Red chili peppers dried"
- " Garlic"
- " Bawang merah shallots or regular onions"
- " Belacan shrimp paste"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely cut up the dried red chili peppers with a pair of kitchen scissors."
- "Cut them into thin pieces at an angle as shown. Your hands may burn from the oil coating the surface of the peppers, so I recommend wearing gloves; watch TV while cutting, since it takes a bit of time."
- "Remove as many seeds as possible. With your hand covered in a plastic bag, rub the cut peppers together to release the seeds; they&#39;ll filter through the colander."
- "I filtered this many seeds with 150 g of red chili peppers (about 2/3 cup)."
- "Rinse the cut peppers, then soak them in water for about 1/2 day, refreshing the water twice. When draining, there will be fine bits to discard, so drain slowly to separate them out."
- "These are bawang merah onions. They can also be found as &#34;hom daeng,&#34; the Thai word for shallots. They can be bought online, but since (I suspect) they&#39;re expensive, you can substitute with regular onions."
- "This is belacan, a dried paste made from baby shrimp. If you don&#39;t have any, you should be able to substitute with the Thai condiment &#34;kapi&#34; or with Japanese &#34;ami no shiokara&#34; (fermented krill)."
- "Place all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend into a smooth paste. It&#39;s done!"
- "Transfer the sambal to a Tupperware or resealable container, and store it in your refrigerator; it can keep for about 6 months if stored in the chilled compartment. You could also divide it into smaller portions and freeze them."
- "You can&#39;t eat this sambal as is, it needs to be used in cooking, not as a finishing sauce so be careful. For the type of sambal that can be eaten as is, refer to.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143918-sambal-malaysian-chili-pepper-sauce"
