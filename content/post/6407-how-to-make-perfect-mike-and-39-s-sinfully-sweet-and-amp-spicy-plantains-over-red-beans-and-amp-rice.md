recipeinstructions:
- "Fresh Green Plantains. Know these plantains are far less sweet than yellow or black plantains and they&#39;re much harder to peel. They&#39;ll afford you the flavor of bananas but not the sweetness whatsoever. Hence the heavy brown sugar addition."
- "Heat your butter and oil with all seasonings, except for your rum."
- "Cut the ends of your plantains. Slice your plantains in half. If your plantains are long, cut horizontally then vertically. These pictured are pretty short, fat and stubby. Peel."
- "Place plantains in your heated pan and fry for 7 minutes. Flip occasionally."
- "Pull your plantains and allow them to cool for a few minutes."
- "Place plantains on wax paper. Quickly coat plantains with additional seasonings, if desired. I&#39;ll always add additional brown sugar and Cayenne Pepper to them at this point. Press them down with a plate or rolling pin on wax paper. This action will not only seal in your additional seasonings but, also help to soften and caramelize your plantains even further."
- "Place plantains back into your heated butter/oil/seasoning mixture with your rum and fry for up to 3 minutes longer. Flambé rum of you know how to do it safely. Add additional butter or oil if needed but, you shouldn&#39;t."
- "Drain your carmelized plantains on wax paper and separate. Otherwise they&#39;ll stick together."
- "Serve alongside any spicy meat, black beans and rice or, over white or red beans and rice. Today, my students wanted them over a simple Cuban Red Beans &amp; Rice recipe. Enjoy!"
