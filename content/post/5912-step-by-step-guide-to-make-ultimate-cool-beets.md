recipeingredient:
- "4 medium beets"
- "1 bunch purple shiso"
- "10 fresh walnuts"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tbsp sherry vinegar"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the greens from your beets. If they&#39;re nice greens, you can cook them like you would chard or collards. Try not to throw them away if you can avoid it."
- "In a pot, submerge your beets in water and get the stove on medium. If the water does come to a boil before they&#39;re done cooking, cut the heat to a gentle bubble. Root vegetables tend to get kinda water-logged bu a vigorous boiling."
- "Now, how do you know when your beets are done?... Well, I can&#39;t give you an exact time because nature makes beets of all different sizes. To check if they&#39;re done, you&#39;ll need a thin, pointy object of some type. If it seems like it&#39;s been long enough for the cooking to get to the middle, stab your biggest beet. It should yield readily to the point."
- "Then you just strain and rinse them under cold water. The skin should peel off easily by hand."
- "Dice the beets to around 1/2&#34; or so."
- "Julienne the shiso, not too fine, or it will bind up and get lost. Shuck the walnuts and break them up a bit. Toss it all together."
- "Add oil and vinegar and season to your liking with salt and pepper. Just try not to overpower that beet/shiso flavor."
