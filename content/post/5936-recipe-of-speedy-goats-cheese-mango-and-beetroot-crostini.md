Beetroot and goat&#39;s cheese is a well-known pairing, but it&#39;s the maple syrup, chilli and chive dressing that makes these croquettes special. Mash the goat&#39;s cheese in a bowl using a fork. Add the beetroot and mix well (I like to use my hands) until everything comes together, then season liberally. Toast the bread slices and then spread with goat&#39;s cheese, top with a little of the beetroot mix and garnish with micro basil or fresh coriander. Crostini with a mix of sweet and savoury flavours via fresh or roasted fruit and fruit jellies are my favorite kind of appetizer.
