recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the lentils till the water runs clean. Add turmeric to the lentils and pressure cook on medium flame for at least 6 whistles. If you are using instant pot, pressure cook for at least 30 min, till the lentils are completely mush.Heat ghee (Substituting oil/ reducing the quantity will compromise the taste) in a Kadai/ frying pan, add cumin, cook till it is fragrant.
