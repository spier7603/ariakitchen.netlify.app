recipeingredient:
- "8-10 cups organic mixed greens of your choice"
- "4 medium beets washed"
- "2 tsp olive oil for roasting beets"
- "Pinch salt"
- "2 large carrots shaved into ribbons or grated"
- "1/2 cup crumbled goats milk cheese"
- "1/3 cup pecans chopped"
- "1/3 cup dried cranberries"
- "1/4 cup green onion chopped"
- " Vinaigrette Ingredients"
- "3 tbsp honey"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tbsp balsamic vinegar"
- "1 tsp Dijon mustard"
- " Juice of 2 fresh oranges"
- "To taste salt  pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. While oven is preheating, line a small baking dish with parchment paper."
- "Wash beets and cut off stems (no need to peel at this point). Place them in the parchment lined baking dish and toss in 2 tsp olive oil and a pinch of salt. Keeping the peel on during roasting helps prevent them from bleeding and making a big mess."
- "Roast beets for 45-50 min. Remove from oven, let cool in the dish for 5-10 min. They&#39;ll still be warm, but you&#39;ll be able to handle them without burning yourself."
- "While waiting for beets to cool, measure the greens into a large bowl."
- "Grate or slice carrots into ribbons using your vegetable peeler, chop green onions, and measure out goat cheese, pecans, and dried cranberries."
- "Remove skin from beets with a vegetable peeler, and chop beets into bite sized chunks."
- "Sprinkle carrots over salad greens, add chopped beets, goat cheese, pecans, green onions, and dried cranberries. Set aside while you prepare the vinaigrette."
- "To a medium mason jar, add the honey, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and the juice of 2 oranges. Add a pinch or two of salt and pepper."
- "Close the jar lid tightly and shake ink all ingredients are combined. The mustard in the dressing not only adds flavour, but acts as an emulsifier to keep the oil and vinegar from separating."
- "Drizzle the vinaigrette over salad to your taste, gently toss, and serve."
- "This salad is best served immediately, but you can prep the ingredients the day before and assemble when ready to serve."
