recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a medium sauce pan over medium high heat. Add olive oil. Heat until it is shimmering but not smoking. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to just under medium and sweat veggies until onion begins to turn translucent but all are still crisp, stirring often. About 5 minutes."
- "Turn heat back up to medium. Add sliced andouille sausage to the pan (I used 4 Johnsonville, &#34;New Orleans Brand&#34; andouille sausage links). Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add parsley, thyme, Creole/Cajun seasoning, chopped garlic and cayenne (if using). Cook 2 minutes more, stirring constantly so garlic doesn&#39;t burn."
- "Add two cans of dark red kidney beans with liquid and 1 cup chicken stock to pan. Stir to combine. Drain almost all liquid from third can (leave about 2 tsp, helps with mashing), do not rinse beans. Dump beans into a medium bowl and mash with the back of a fork, slotted spoon, or even hand potato masher. Add mashed beans to pan. Stir to combine."
- "Increase heat to medium high, bring to a low boil for about 2 minutes, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Sauce should nice and thick after 20 minutes."
- "For rice: While waiting for beans to boil begin making your rice. In another sauce pan bring the remaining 2 cups of chicken stock to a boil over medium high heat, add 1 cup long grain rice. Stir gently, cover, reduce heat to medium low and cook in the same 20 minutes that your beans are simmering. Do not remove the lid in this time!"
- "After 20 minutes remove rice from heat and fluff with a fork. Turn off heat for beans, taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Place 1/2 cup rice in each bowl (up to 4 servings), top with desired amount of red beans (roughly 1 cup for us) and enjoy! You WILL have leftover red beans. Lol.
