recipeingredient:
- " Olive oil small bottle"
- " Red chili peppers"
- " Garlic"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the garlic lengthwise, remove the core, and slice thinly. Cut off the tops of the chili peppers with scissors, and make a cut in the middle to remove the seeds. Cut them into thin rounds with scissors."
- "Pour the olive oil, chili peppers and garlic into a deep frying pan, and heat over low heat."
- "Turn off the heat just before the garlic turns golden brown. The residual heat will continue cooking the mixture."
- "While the oil is cooling, the garlic will turn dark, as shown in this photo. When it&#39;s cooled completely, pour the mixture back into the bottle. It&#39;s not so spicy when it&#39;s freshly made."
- "There are various shapes of olive oil bottles, and the one I bought this time had a plastic cap like this one. I couldn&#39;t take this off, and I didn&#39;t have a funnel on hand..."
- "After much agonizing, I cut off a corner of a small plastic bag, put the opened corner into the bottle, and poured in the oil through the plastic bag. The garlic and chili didn&#39;t go in easily, so I pushed them into the bottle with a chopstick. It went surprisingly well."
- "Apparently, the spiciness will increase starting the next day, and the oil will become spicier and redder as time goes on. I&#39;m not sure how long it can be stored, but K-mama said she made hers a while ago."
- "The chili peppers I used were about 10 cm long. They are probably 2-3 times longer than average-sized chili peppers. I used 2 of those, making the oil mildly spicy."
- "I drizzled this oil over a salad, and it was super delicious. It&#39;s great for freshly boiled pasta. It was also delicious with a deep-fried dish."
