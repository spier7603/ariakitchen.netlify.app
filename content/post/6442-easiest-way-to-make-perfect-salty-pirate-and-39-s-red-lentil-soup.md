recipeinstructions:
- "To create the Black Bean Stock: state with 1 lb dry black beans. I recommend against pre-soaking to capture full flavor, but pre-soak will cut time in half. Wash in cold water for 3-5 minutes, drain off (pre-soak 8-12 hours optionally at this point save water if so). Bring to a full boil in a large pot for 15 minutes, strain any foam off. Lower to a medium simmer and add ground pepper. (The beans will boil over easily so keep an eye on them). After 30-45 minutes test a bean, if it&#39;s starting to tender (fully chewable) then lower to low simmer and add salt. After about 90-120 minutes total beans should be done (will vary). Scoop out beans or pour through a civ to save boil water as stock."
- "Place dry split red lentils in the hot stock and bring up to a low boil (you may need to add some additional water as needed)."
- "While the lentils are boiling in a separate pan sauté chopped/diced red onion and garlic in butter (I used goats milk butter for a lighter creamy taste). Sauté until well browned and caramelized. Remove from heat."
- "When lentils have been boiling for 20 minutes add sautéed garlic/onions and mix in all of the spices. Lower temp and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure spices infuse and no beans are sticking to the pot."
