- "Remove the saucepan from flame and allow it to cool. I have kept it overnight, immersed in the syrup for the deep colour, this is the great tip to obtain the bright maroon colour, but this is optional.  Gently remove the pears from liquid and boil the syrup further until the liquid becomes slightly thicker. Off the flame and let the syrup come to room temperature."
- "Serve each pear by drizzling some syrup and scope of ice-cream per person."
