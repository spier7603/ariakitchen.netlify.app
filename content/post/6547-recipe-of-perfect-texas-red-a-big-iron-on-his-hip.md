- "After final simmer check consistency is as you want it, if too soupy leave simmering longer; When adding time- remove lid and leave uncovered. Cooking longer will also reduce bitterness or spiciness if that is an issue.  Often I end up cooking at the lowest boil I can get (maybe just above &#34;low&#34; on your range) for 2-3 hrs more- checking it every hour or so and stiring to keep sides from getting too gunky."
- "In order to cook off alcohol you will need to cook for 4-7hrs total (even then there may be a little left). Gets better after a day in the fridge; do not be afraid of the fat that solidifies at the top- that&#39;s flavortown. Feel free to skim approx. 3/4s of that off, if you want."
