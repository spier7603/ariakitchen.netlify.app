- "Add the oregano, epazote, chipotle, ancho, salt, and the bhut jolokia, and stir and simmer a few minutes."
- "A note on the bhut jolokia. That little dried bhut jolokia, or ghost chili, raises the alarms from about 1 to 3. So, if you are faint of heart, you may want to skip the bhut."
- "Add the TVP, the soy sauce, and all of the tomato ingredients, and stir the lumps of tomato out."
- "Now add the beans and peanut butter. Remember, you want the natural peanut butter, not the one with partially hydrogenated oils and sugar added. Stir well to incorporate the peanut butter."

- "For the finish, add in the cilantro, salt to taste, and serve."
- "A couple of notes: First, you may find yourself adding a notable amount of salt to get the flavor to your liking. Most commercial chili is pretty salty. Second, the chili, as pictured, is fresh made, but chili is always better and thicker the second day."
