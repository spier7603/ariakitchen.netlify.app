recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 4 / 180C / 350°F with and line 2 baking trays with foil and have 2 spare baking trays handy"
- "Peel the beets and slice very thinly, 1/16 inch thick with a mandolin but be careful of your fingers. In a large bowl, toss the sliced beets with the extra virgin olive oil"
- "Arrange the beets in a single layer on each tray and sprinkle with a small amount of the salt. You can use plain sea salt or any flavoured salt of preferrence. Stack an extra baking tray on top of each layer of beetroot. This keeps the crisps flat. Put one tray on the oven top shelf and the other on the bottom"
- "Bake until the edges of the beets begin to dry out, about 20 minutes. Peek around 17 minutes to check! Remove the extra trays that are on top of the beets and rotate the trays so the top one now goes in the bottom and the bottom one goes to the top"
- "Bake a further 17 - 20 minutes. Remove the crisps as they become lighter in color. Transfer to a wire rack, they will crisp up as they cool"
- "Keep in a lidded container for up to a week"
